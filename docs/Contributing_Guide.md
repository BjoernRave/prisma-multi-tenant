## 1. Finding an issue to work on

Building Open Source projects is a collaborative process. Features and bug requests are discussed with maintainers and users to find the best solution to the problems at hand.

If you want to work on [an already existing issue](https://github.com/Errorname/prisma-multi-tenant/issues), **add a comment saying you are working on it**. Otherwise, there may be multiple people working on the same issue.

If you want to work on something else, please **create an issue explaining what you want to do**. People will then be able to give you some ideas or context to help you.

> Note: Want to contribute but don't know where to start? Send me a message on [Prisma's Slack](https://slack.prisma.io/) (@Errorname)!
