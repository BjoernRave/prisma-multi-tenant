## 1. Finding an issue to work on

Building Open Source projects is a collaborative process. Features and bug requests are discussed with maintainers and users to find the best solution to the problems at hand.

If you want to work on [an already existing issue](https://github.com/Errorname/prisma-multi-tenant/issues), **add a comment saying you are working on it**. Otherwise, there may be multiple people working on the same issue.

If you want to work on something else, please **create an issue explaining what you want to do**. People will then be able to give you some ideas or context to help you.

> Note: Want to contribute but don't know where to start? Send me a message on [Prisma's Slack](https://slack.prisma.io/) (@Errorname)!

## 2. Cloning and installing Prisma-multi-tenant

Once you have an issue, you can clone and install Prisma-multi-tenant:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Errorname/prisma-multi-tenant.git
npm install
```

## 3. Running and linking Prisma-multi-tenant

Prisma-multi-tenant is a mono-repository hosting 3 packages:

- `prisma-multi-tenant` found in `/packages/cli`
- `@prisma-multi-tenant/client` found in `/packages/client`
- `@prisma-multi-tenant/shared` found in `/packages/shared`

Those packages are written in Typescript. For each one of those package, you will need to build it with the following command:

```sh
cd packages/shared
npm run build -- -w

cd packages/cli
npm run build -- -w

cd packages/client
npm run build -- -w
```

Since NPM installs dependencies from its own repositories, we need to locally link our packages between them:

```sh
cd packages/shared
npm link

cd packages/cli
npm link
npm link @prisma-multi-tenant/shared

cd packages/client
npm link
npm link @prisma-multi-tenant/shared
```

Now, whenever you use the command `prisma-multi-tenant` or `pmt`, it will use your local version.

When using `@prisma-multi-tenant/client` in a project, you will also want to execute your own builded version of `@prisma-multi-tenant/client`. To do that, go into your project's directory and "link" it:

```sh
# In your project's directory
npm link @prisma-multi-tenant/client
```

You can now work on your issue! ðŸ¥³

## 4. Creating the Pull Request

Your contribution is working beyond expectation? Great, let's add it to the project!

But first, let's make sure your code is correctly formatted, and doesn't introduce regressions:

```sh
# In the root of prisma-multi-tenant
npm run check
```

Everything's green? Perfect!
